* As a first time user, I want to be able to sign up to access the games
* As a returning user, I want to be able to sign in to see my games
* As a returning user, I want to be able to access a list of all completed games
* As a user, I want to be able to create a new game
* As a user, I want to be able to choose if I am X or O
* As a user, I want to be able to change my password

## Planning and Development Stage:
The first step for this project was creating a wireframe and  writing user stories of basic functionalities that are important to the game. I tried to keep this very basic, as I didn't know how hard it would be to build the game and deploy it, and I didn't want to set my goals too high.

Then when I went to begin the project, I started with creating a board in html with bootstrap, so that I could visualize the game. Having the game board definitely helped me when I went to start on game logic and wanted to be able to see the board populating with X and O.

After I had a very basic board that populated with X and O, I worked on the User Auth part of the project. But at this point, my user was disconnected with my board, and I had not yet acessed the Game API.

Once I worked out the basic game logic, I had many many lines of code. So, I had to go back and refactor it all, to consolidate it - in doing this, I also ran into quite a few problems. But using console.log, I was able to resolve most of them.

If I were to do this project again, I think that I would have implemented the Game API earlier in the process, because I ran into an issue where it was working in the local browser, but was not pushing to the API.

The last step, and the one that I found the esaiest was styling my board, so the game is beautiful. Since this step, is not a requirement, I tried to make sure that I didn't spend too much time on it.


## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans:

The main concern for future plans, will be to make sure that the game is responsive, and works on different size screens. Then a further goal, could be to add multiplayer functionality.
